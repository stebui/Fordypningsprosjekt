\noindent The GeoMod software offers visualisation and simulation for geometric models. The software has been developed as independent modules that are united. This project thesis presents the development of a control system based on forward and inverse kinematics for vehicles and tools with an interactive graphical user interface. The control system enables translation and rotation of geometrical model in three Cartesian axes. A reference system is implemented for vehicles and tools to move along a chosen path. The procedure of the control system for the tools is reviewed, this allows the relation between the end-effector and a vehicle to interact with a path by inverse kinematics. Freely-stand modules that are implemented is addressed to design a unified control system for autonomous vehicles. The goal is to have a comprehensive system working as a framework for further development.
