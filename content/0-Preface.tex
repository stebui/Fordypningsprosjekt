{\centering\huge\bfseries Preface \par}
\noindent This project thesis was written in the fall 2016 for my specialisation project. The project with a specialisation course is a prerequisite before one can write a master thesis. Among many topics to write about, the subject of autonomous system piqued my interest and was chosen for my assignment. The specialisation course, TMM4280 - Advanced Product Development, was taken alongside this project.

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Professor Sven Fjeldaas for his first-rate guidance and helpful inputs throughout this project.
